# Predictive Maintenance of Industrial Machinery

## Project Description
This project aims to develop a machine learning model to predict potential failures in industrial machines before they occur. By analyzing sensor data, the model classifies the type of failure, enabling proactive maintenance to reduce downtime and operational costs.

## Technology Used
-   **Platform:** IBM Watsonx AI Studio
-   **Programming Language:** Python
-   **Libraries:**
    -   `pandas`: For data manipulation and analysis.
    -   `scikit-learn`: For building the machine learning model and evaluating its performance.
    -   `matplotlib` & `seaborn`: For data visualization, specifically to create the confusion matrix.

## Key Findings
The developed model, a **Random Forest Classifier**, achieved an overall accuracy of **99%** on the test dataset. The model successfully identified common failure types, demonstrating its potential to be an effective tool for predictive maintenance.
